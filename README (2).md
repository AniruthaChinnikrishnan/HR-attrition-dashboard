# **HR Analytics Dashboard – Attrition, Satisfaction \& Performance**

## **Project Overview**

This project is a compact yet comprehensive **HR Analytics Dashboard** designed for quick insights into employee attrition, job satisfaction, and performance. Built with **Power BI**, it demonstrates the ability to transform HR data into meaningful, decision‑ready visuals.

The goal is to showcase:

* Strong analytical thinking
* Understanding of HR fundamentals
* Ability to create clean, structured dashboards

This project uses the **IBM HR Analytics Employee Attrition Dataset**, a widely used real‑world simulation dataset.
